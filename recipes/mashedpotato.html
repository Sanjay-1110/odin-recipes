    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mashed potatoes are a dish of boiled or steamed potatoes that are mashed into a soft, smooth consistency and often mixed with milk and butter. They are commonly served as a side dish with meat or vegetables, but can also be used as an ingredient in other dishes like dumplings and gnocchi.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 /2 cup milk Do not add all the milk at once. Add slowly then stir then add more as needed. Adding too much will make runny potatoes.</li>
        <li>3 lbs yukon potatoes or russet potatoes (peeled and quartered)</li>
        <li>8 tbsp butter softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream plus additional 3 tbsp</li>
        <li>salt and pepper for taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the peeled and quartered potatoes to a large pot. Fill the pot up with just enough cold water to cover the potatoes. Set the stove to medium high heat. Cook until the potatoes are soft enough to pierce easily with a fork. Drain. </li>
        <li>Place the potatoes back into the pot and cover the potatoes for about 5 mins. Heat up the milk until itâ€™s hot. </li>
        <li>Pour half of the hot milk (see notes), softened butter and sour cream into the pot and mash until you get your desired consistency. If the mash is too thick, add a bit more milk until you get your desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with pats of butter. </li>
    </ol>
